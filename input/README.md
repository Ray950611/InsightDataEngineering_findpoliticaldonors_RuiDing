The itcon.txt file is the given sample input test file.
I have selected the first 5000 lines from the online data file itcont.txt which is the original full dataset and it is named
itcont_1.txt here.
It is also used as the test input file for my own test2 in the testsuites.
A smaller portion of itcont_1.txt is selected and named itcont_2.txt.
It is also used as the test input file for my own test3 in the testsuites.
